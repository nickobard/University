# SWI - Software Engineering

## SYNOPSIS
Students get acquainted with methods of analysis and design of larger software projects that are typically designed and implemented in teams. They consolidate and practically verify their knowledge during the analysis and design of larger software systems that will be developed in the concurrent course BIE-SP1. Students get hands-on experience with CASE tools using the visual language UML for modeling and solving software problems. Students learn the basics of object-oriented analysis, architecture design and testing. Within the course, students also gain a theoretical basis in the field of project management, estimation of costs of software projects, and methods of their development.
