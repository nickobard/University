# GIT - SW Development Technologies

## SYNOPSIS
This course is aimed at one of the rudimental team software development technology - version control. To be more specific, we will introduce students to Git, the information manager from hell, as Linus Torvalds nicknamed it, and provide a comprehensive guide into its depths, as well as for day-to-day use.

## COURSE CONTENTS
Students will be introduced to the basic principles of version control systems. These principles will be then shown (up to the implementation level) on DVCS Git both theoretically and practically. The aim is to provide the necessary knowledge of the usage of versioning systems during code development. Students will be then challenged to use Git as users, project managers or team leaders and motivated to use the Git versioning system in parallel courses BIE-UOS and BIE-PA1.

## GOALS OF STUDY
Introduce students to principles of versioning and provide them with both theoretical and practical know-how to successfully collaborate on team projects, or even version projects of their own.
