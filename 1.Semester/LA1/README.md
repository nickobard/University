# LA1 - Linear Algebra 1

## SYNOPSIS
We will introduce students to the basic concepts of linear algebra, such as vectors, matrices, vector spaces. We will define vector spaces over the field of real and complex numbers and also over finite fields. We will present the concepts of basis and dimension and learn to solve systems of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method (GEM) and show the connection with linear manifolds. We define the regularity of matrices and learn to find their inversions using GEM. We will also learn to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. We will also demonstrate some applications of these concepts in computer science.
