# DML - Discrete Mathematics and Logic

## SYNOPSIS
Students will get acquainted with the basic concepts of propositional logic and predicate logic and learn to work with their laws. Necessary concepts from set theory will be explained. Special attention is paid to relations, their general properties, and their types, especially functional relations, equivalences, and partial orders. The course also lays down the basics of combinatorics and number theory, with emphasis on modular arithmetics.
