# PA1 - Programming and Algorithmics 1

## SYNOPSIS
Students gain the ability to formulate algorithms for solving basic problems and write them in the C language. They understand data types (simple, structured, pointers), expressions, statements, functions, concept of recursion. They learn to analyse simple cases of algorithm complexity. They know fundamental algorithms for searching, sorting, and manipulating with linked lists and trees.

## COURSE CONTENTS
Students learn to construct algorithms for solving basic problems and write them in the C language. They master data types (simple, pointers, structured), expressions, statements, and functions presented in C language. They understand the principle of recursion and basics of algorithm complexity analysis. They know fundamental algorithms for searching, sorting, and manipulating linked lists and trees.

## GOALS OF STUDY
The module provides fundamental algorithmics and procedural programming skills that are crucial for further studying.
