# Managerial Psychology

## SYNOPSIS

Students will be introduced to the basic psychological principles relevant to managerial practice and human resource management. They will understand the fundamentals of cognitive and behavioral approaches, the importance of a manager's personality, internal attitudes, behavior, interactions, and communication. Students will learn about personality theories, intelligence, motivation, and cognitive and affective processes. Selected techniques will be practiced through hands-on exercises. The knowledge gained in this course can be applied both in future employment and in everyday life.

The foundation of the course is psychology as a modern science, not a collection of superficial clich√©s, esoteric indoctrination, or pseudo-scientific conclusions, with which the field of personnel and managerial psychology is traditionally heavily overgrown. The course is designed and taught from the perspective of someone who has dedicated 20 years to this field and has also made it their profession. This course does not provide instructions on how to quickly and easily join the ranks of stellar leaders or adopt "first-league" thinking. It does not contain tactics for outsmarting others or gaining a "psychological" advantage over them, as while that may be possible, it goes against the lecturer's personal values. Upon completing the course, you may be more informed, perhaps more experienced, but certainly not happier. This course does not glorify psychologists, managers, or managerial psychologists.
