# DB Technologies for Big Data

## Synopsis
Students will be introduced into the field of Big Data processing where nonrelational (NoSQL) database engines are typically used today. The course is focused practically so that after finishing the course students were able to choose suitable tools (mostly open source) and techniques,design and implement a simplest reproducible method of data processing (data collection, transformation/aggregation, presentation). Students get acquainted with various architectures for processing and storing big data. A theoretical foundation and presentation of individual technologies will be supplemented with specific examples from practice.

## Course contents
Students will be introduced into the field of Big Data processing where nonrelational (NoSQL) database engines are typically used today. The course is focused practically so that after finishing the course students were able to choose suitable tools (mostly open source) and techniques,design and implement a simplest reproducible method of data processing (data collection, transformation/aggregation, presentation). Students get acquainted with various architectures for processing and storing big data. A theoretical foundation and presentation of individual technologies will be supplemented with specific examples from practice.

## Goals of study
After completing this course, the student will be able to distinguish between individual types of noSQL databases and work with Big Data. He will be able to design and implement suitable solutions for various use cases. At a slightly advanced level, they will learn to work with key-value, document, column and graph NoSQL databases. The Elastic Stack ecosystem and a basic overview of the Hadoop ecosystem (Map Reduce, HDFS, YARN, Apache Spark) are part of practical and theoretical knowledge. As part of the course, the student will learn about data visualization options and the process of cleaning and transforming various data sets.
