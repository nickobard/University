# Data Preprocessing

## Synopsis
Students learn to prepare raw data for further processing and analysis. They learn what algorithms can be used to extract information from various data sources, such as images, texts, time series, etc., and learn the skills to apply these theoretical concepts to solve specific problems in individual projects - e.g., extraction of characteristics from images or from web pages.

## Course contents
Students learn to prepare raw data for further processing and analysis. They learn what algorithms can be used to extract parameters from various data sources, such as images, texts, time series, etc., and learn the skills to apply these theoretical concepts to solve a specific problem in individual projects - e.g., parameter extraction from image data or from Internet.

## Goals of study
Data preprocessing is crucial for successful data processing and takes a lot of time - usually more than the data processing itself. Knowledge of algorithms for extraction of parameters from various data sources is a fundamental part of knowledge engineering,
