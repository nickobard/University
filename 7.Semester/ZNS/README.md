# Knowledge-based Systems

## Synopsis
Students will become familiar with the systems based on knowledge (knowledge-based systems), which are systems that usetechniques of artificial intelligence to solve problems that require human judgment, learning and reasoning from findingsand actions. The course introduces students to the philosophy and architecture of knowledge-based systems to support decision-makingand planning. The course assumes knowledge of set theory, probability theory, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms.
