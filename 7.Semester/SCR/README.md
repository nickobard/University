# Statistical Analysis of Time Series

## Synopsis
The course deals with the practical use of the basic time series modelling theory in engineering tasks, ranging from economics (stock exchange prices, employment) and industrial problems (modelling of signals and processes) to computer networks (network components load, attacks detection). The students learn to select a convenient process model, estimate its parameters, analyze its properties and use it for forecasting of future or intermediate values. The stress is put on understanding and adoption of the main principles based on practical real-world examples. Both the lab classes and the lectures exploit freely available software packages in order to provide easy and straightforward transfer of students' knowledge from the academic to the real world.
