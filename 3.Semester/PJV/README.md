## COURSE CONTENTS
The course Programming in Java introduces students to object-oriented programming in the Java programming language. In addition to the language itself, basic libraries for working with files, streams, networks, collections, databases, and multithreaded programming will be covered.

## GOALS OF STUDY
The goal is to teach students the Java programming language and the active ability to use basic Java libraries.

## LECTURES SYLLABUS
1. Introduction, history of Java, editions and versions, operators and their precedence, first executable code.
2. Keywords, program creation, its execution, concepts of class, attribute, method, inheritance, and encapsulation.
3. Inheritance among classes, abstract classes and interfaces, attribute inheritance, shadowing, overriding, constructors.
4. Polymorphism, exceptions, their division, creation, propagation through the program, and handling.
5. Arrays, parameterized classes (generics), collections, sorting, comparison, hashing.
6. Input and output: Getting information about the OS, the file system, working with files, text and binary streams, serialization.
7. StreamAPI, lambda expressions, functional interfaces.
8. Threads: Multithreaded applications, thread synchronization, their lifecycle, priorities, interruptions, common problems.
9. Networking in Java: Basic concepts, differences between TCP and UDP, classes for network communication, client-server architecture.
10. Creating GUI and the JavaFX library: its basic parts and classes, working with FXML, responsive design, layout of elements, controls.
11. JavaFX events, animations, transitions, and transformations.
12. Databases: Basics of relational databases, connecting to a DB using Java, classes for executing commands, processing data obtained from queries, SQL data types vs. Java data types.
13. (if the semester has 13 weeks) New features in Java 9 and later.
