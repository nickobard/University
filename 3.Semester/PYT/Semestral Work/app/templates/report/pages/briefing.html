    This web application is a time-tracking app, which tracks the time spent on users' tasks, saves them, and provides
    some statistics and analysis of users' productivity.
</p>

<p>
    The main inspiration for this app is the Toggl Track app, which is a very popular time-tracking application.
</p>

<p>
    Most important features of this app are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Time tracking - user can create a task and run it with a timer until it is stopped. Also, the user can
            change the name of the task while it is running just by typing a new name and pressing enter key. What is
            most important - you can close the browser and open it again - and time entry still will be running. You can
            stop it in one browser, and the other browser will automatically react and will stop it too. Same with
            starting a new time entry - the timer is synchronized with the server.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Time entries table - user can see time entries in the table, and manipulate with them - filtering time
            entries with the date and time ranges, and also sorting columns. Also, user can create new time entries and
            delete existing ones. Input validation is also supported.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Visualization - on the analysis page user can see some useful charts which provide some statistics about
            users' productivity.
        </p>
    </li>
