<h1>Realization</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    This app is more about used technologies and frameworks than about algorithms. So there won't be complex algorithms
    or math.
</p>
<h4>Architecture:</h4>
<p>
    As it was mentioned - this app has MVC architecture. But because the app is small, backend and frontend are run on
    the same server. Therefore, frontend part - views, which render HTML pages using templates, use directly same
    services that the backend uses. But still, the user's browser is the client, which runs javascript code, which calls
    the backend's API and requests data.
</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                FastAPI is used for creating API and views. Application is run by Uvicorn - ASGI server for python.
            </li>
            <li>
                SQLAlchemy is used for ORM and communicating with the PostgreSQL database, which is run in a docker
                container.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pydantic is used for data validation and creating schemes (aka DTO - data transfer objects). Also
                Pydantic provides configuration for the whole application - special settings class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pandas is used for time entries statistics service, which allows to easily manipulate with data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plotly is used in combination with pandas to visualize users productivity in charts.
            </li>

        <h6>Frontend side:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                HyperApp is a tiny javascript framework used for timer feature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Jinja2 template language is used to render HTML pages with provided data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bootstrap CSS framework is used for a nice UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is worth to mention, than HyperApp and Bootstrap are downloaded by CDN links - their libraries are
                download directly to the users' browser.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>Timer:</h4>
<p>
    The timer feature is created using the HyperApp framework. This framework uses states. Each event or user action
    creates a new state. There is a timer that every half of second updates the current timer count. It is worth
    mentioning, that it doesn't add seconds. In the database, the time entry entity stores the start DateTime and end
    DateTime. Until the end DateTime is null, time entry is still running, and HyperApp just calculates a difference
    between the current time now and the start time, which is stored in the database. Therefore there is impossible any
    significant deviation from the real timer count.</p>
<p>
    The main problem was to ensure syncronized behaivior. For that WebSockets framework was used. It connects user to
    the server and the server periodically sends to the client the state of the currently running entry. If it is still
    running or not. That ensures that timer is syncronized.
</p>
<p>
    For starting time entry or updating its name, HyperApp just uses API calls to backend.
</p>
<h4>Time entries table:</h4>
<p>
    Just on the same page as the timer, the time entries table allows the user to manipulate the data. In backend, there
    is a time entries statistics service, which uses the Pandas framework. Pandas dataframe is loaded directly from the
    database table.
</p>
<p>
    Creating and deleting operations use the backend API, called by JavaScript code in the user's browser.
</p>
<h4>Visualization</h4>
<p>
    Plotly framework is used to create charts and plots directly from pandas dataframe. Then they are converted to HTML
    and rendered by Jinja2 template language.
</p>
<h4>API:</h4>
<p>
    The API of the application is automatically generated by FastAPI - and is located on the <a href="http://localhost:8000/docs">/docs</a> page. It provides not
    only information about API but also allows to make those API calls with provided data.
