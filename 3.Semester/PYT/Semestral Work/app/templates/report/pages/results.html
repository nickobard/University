<h4>Timer:</h4>
<p>
    The timer is working and does what it should be doing. It tracks time, saves it to database, it is synchronized with
    the server. It works very similar like Toggl Track timer.
</p>
<p>
    But of course, there are still problems with it - mainly with milliseconds issue that you don't see as user -
    sometimes it stores time with one second less than it should be.
</p>
<p>
    What could be improved? Certainly the stability, and also allowing to update not only the title of the running task
    but the start date-time too, so the entry can be moved, extended, or shrinked.
</p>
<h4>Time entries table:</h4>
<p>
    It uses Pandas and allows user to manipulate with the data. But still, there is a problem, it doesn't have update
    operations - only create, read and delete. Next time that can be improved.
</p>
<h4>
    Visualization:
</h4>
<p>
    Charts and plots are a very good feature. They really provide useful information for user, and even allows user to
    interact with the charts.
</p>
<p>
    But there could be more charts with much more advanced statistics. This is what could be improved.
</p>
<h4>Overall:</h4>
<p>
    This application uses a lot of different technologies and frameworks. It provides all basic features for the
    tracking app.
