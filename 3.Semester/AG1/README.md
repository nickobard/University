# AG1 - Algorithms and Graphs 1

- Homeworks - main tasks from the course.
- Codeforces - additional tasks.
- Proofs - theoretical tasks.

## SYNOPSIS
The course covers the basics of efficient algorithm design, data structures, and graph theory, belonging to the core knowledge of every computing curriculum.

It links and partially develops the knowledge from the course BI-DML.21, in which students acquire the knowledge and skills in combinatorics necessary for evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms. The course also follows up knowledge from BI-MA1.21, the practical usage of asymptotic mathematics, in particular, the asymptotic notation.

## COURSE CONTENTS
The course covers the basics of efficient algorithm design, data structures, and graph theory, belonging to the core knowledge of every computing curriculum. Students learn techniques of proofs of correctness of algorithms and techniques of asymptotic mathematics for estimation of their complexity in the best, worst, or average case (the course includes basics from probability theory needed for understanding randomized algorithms). Within exercises, students learn applications of studied algorithms for solving practical problems.

## GOALS OF STUDY
Students learn basic techniques for proving the correctness of algorithms and techniques of asymptotic mathematics for estimation of their complexity in the best, worst, or average case.
