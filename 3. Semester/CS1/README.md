# CS1 - Programming in C#

## SYNOPSIS
The goal of the course is to introduce .NET Framework as a multi-language development platform. Then, programming language C#, its fundamental construction, types of variables, operators, arrays, loops, definitions and calls of functions will be discussed. Attention is focused on the object oriented programming in C# - class definition and class instancing, constructors, methods, properties, static members, Garbage Collector, inheritance and polymorphism, collections, delegates, and generics. Debugging and exception processing, as well as work with files are emphasized.

## LECTURES SYLLABUS
1. Conceptual overview
Foundation for applications - .NET Framework, Intermediate Language, Common Language Runtime, Base Class Library, Namespaces, assemblies structure;
Supplements: ADO.NET, ASP.NET, web services, WCF, WF, WPF, Silverlight, Card Space
2. Visual Studio environment: introduction, basic controls (TextBox, Label, Button and others), code and format editing, building of a simple program.
3. Program format, data types, variables and constants, reference and value types, arrays, collections, structures, expressions and operators, control and assignment statements, definitions and calls of functions.
4. Object oriented programming - fundamentals, encapsulation, methods, fields, properties, class definition, overloading, property procedures, object instancing, static properties, constructors, methods and classes.
5. Object creating and destroying: class constructors, garbage collector.
6. Derivation of objects: inheritance, inheritance definition and use, abstract classes and methods.
7. Polymorphism: principles and use, virtual, override.
8. Super-structure properties of the object programming: object class; boxing/unboxing; indexers, iterators; Generics, typed collections; partial classes; anonymous methods;
9. Delegates and event programming: delegates - safety pointers (single/multicast), definition and use of events.
10. Debugging: debug tools for C# .
11. Run-Time exceptions processing: structured exception processing, Exception Class; Try, Catch and Finally statements.
