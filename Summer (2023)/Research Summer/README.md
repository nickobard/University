# Research Summer

Keyword matching is a simple but powerful named entity recognition technique in natural language text, which can be used by itself, or to support systems based on deep learning models. With this approach, for each named entity category (e.g. “bacteria”), a list of related keywords (e.g. “Salmonella”, “Streptococcus”) is provided, which is then used for the matching of words in query texts.


This topic focuses on the research and development of advanced keyword-matching techniques, such as phrase matching (e.g. ”Escherichia coli”) or fuzzy matching (e.g. ”E. coli”). Numerous approaches can be investigated, such as similarity-based methods (e.g. edit distance, word embeddings, or phrase embeddings), or techniques used in the related problem of word alignment [1]. These approaches will be qualitatively compared. An important factor is computational efficiency, as the number of candidate phrases explodes with longer texts.
