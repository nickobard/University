# VIZ - Data Visualization

## SYNOPSIS
The course offers an overview of the types and characteristics of data as well as suitable visualization methods. This will aid the students in understanding data, their content and their application in areas such as data mining and machine learning. Within the course, students will be introduced to exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and ways of visualizing different kinds of data such as text, social networks, time series or basic image data processing. Students will get hands-on experience in applications of selected methods to real-world examples in the Python programming language.
