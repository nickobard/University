## II. Re-using data
> Before you decide to embark on any new study, it is good practice to check all options to re-use existing available data, either collected or generated by yourself in an earlier project, or data from others (Barend Mons calls this "Other PEople's Data And Services" or OPEDAS). This can include reusable data that have been created for an earlier study, and also so-called "reference data" which is used by many projects.
> 
> It is not because we can generate massive amounts of data that we always need to do so. Creating data with public money is bringing with it the responsibility to treat those data well and (if potentially useful) make them available for re-use by others. And the circle is only complete if such data is actually re-used.

### Questions



#### 1 Do you need guidance to find existing data?


> Research funding organisations more and more demand that you search for existing data sets that could have information that you need, before assuming you need to collect all data yourself. You are asked to list what you have been able to locate, and whether you have found it suitable to use in your research. Do you need pointers to find such existing data sets?

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 2 Is there any pre-existing data?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon Europe DMP*, *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *maDMP*, *Science Europe DMP*

* 📖 **Data Stewardship for Open Science:** [atq](https://ds-review.ds-wizard.org/book-references/atq)

* 🔗 **External links**: [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com), [Datacite Search](https://search.datacite.org), [RDMkit on Reusing Data](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/reusing), [RDMkit on Existing Data](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/existing_data.html)
> Are there any data sets available in the world that are relevant to your planned research?
✔️ a. No
💡 It is possible that you have overlooked existing data! This question is not only about data sets that are similar to what you want to determine yourself, but also reference data or data that should be mined from the existing literature. Further, it is very likely that you will refer to related data, e.g. other databases where you usually "quickly look something up", but that could maybe be properly integrated, especially if you need to do such lookups multiple times.

## III. Creating and collecting data
> In this chapter we describe all the sources of data: they can e.g. come from instruments or from questionnaires; data can be newly collected as part of the current project, but it can also be pre-existing data that may need proper contracts with the maintainer, some pre-processing, and quality checks. It can also be reference data that is part of curated resources and (public) databases.

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 2 Will you be collecting physical samples?

* 📖 **Data Stewardship for Open Science:** [kuz](https://ds-review.ds-wizard.org/book-references/kuz)

> Will you be collecting artefacts like specimens, minerals, biological samples?
✔️ a. No


#### 3 How will you do file naming and file organization?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


* 🔗 **External links**: [RDMkit on data organisation](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_organisation.html)
> Putting some thoughts into file naming can save a lot of trouble later. 

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 4 Do you need guidance on what data formats/types to use?


> In many research fields there are standard file formats and types that have been established by disciplinary standards organisations. Using such standards can help increase the interoperability of your data with other data and tools. Do you need help finding the right standards to use in your research?

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 5 What existing data formats/types will you be using?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*

* 📖 **Data Stewardship for Open Science:** [njy](https://ds-review.ds-wizard.org/book-references/njy)

> Have you identified types of data that you will use that are used by others too? Some types of data (for example "images" or "tables") are used by many different projects. For such data, often common standards exist (in our example "JPG" and "CSV" [comma separated values]) that help to make these data reusable. Are you using such common data formats?
> 
> Please make sure you list all the data types that are important for your project. You should make sure also to list the formats used in any data sets that you are re-using.

#### 5.a.1 Data format/type
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


✔️ ISO/TS 19115-3:2016 Geographic information -- Metadata -- Part 3: XML schema implementation for fundamental concepts(FAIRsharing: [10.25504/FAIRsharing.9de4c3](https://fairsharing.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.9de4c3}))
#### 5.a.2 Is this a standard data format widely used by researchers in this field?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


✔️ a. No

#### 5.a.2.a.1 Why are you using a non-standard format?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


✔️ a. There is no standardized format for this data type

#### 5.a.3 Does this data format enable sharing and long term archiving?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


> Complicated (binary) file formats tend to change over time, and software may not stay compatible with older versions. Also, some formats (e.g. DOC, XLS) hamper long term usability by making use of patents or being hampered by restrictive licensing. 
> 
> Ideally a format should be simple, text only, completely described, not restricted by copyrights, and implemented in different software packages.
✔️ b. Yes

#### 5.a.4 What volume of data of this type will you be working with?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


✔️ a. So small that it is not a problem

#### 5.a.5 Is this data format completely described?


> Formats like XLS or SQL are very flexible; they can be adapted to many different uses, and this makes them good for interoperability. However, their flexibility also makes that it is not immediately obvious from the file structure how it can be used. The data needs a proper *description* in order for others (or yourself at a later time) to be able to unambiguously understand what it contains.

#### 12.b.1 What software will you be using to collect all data?



❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 13 Will you collect any data connected to a person, "personal data"?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon Europe DMP*


* 🔗 **External links**: [RDMkit about Sensitive Data](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/sensitive_data.html), [RDMkit on Human Data](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/human_data.html), [RDMkit on Data Protection](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_protection.html)
> Very many kinds of data are connected to people. If there could be a way for someone, including yourself, to find out who that person is, that is considered personal data.
> 
> Simple examples are name, birth day or address; but there are many other data that can be personal: for example a voice recording, a combination of a location and a time (traffic flow), genetic information, or an X-ray of the skull.

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 14 How is the ownership of the collected data arranged?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*



❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 15 Will you monitor data integrity once it has been collected?

* 📖 **Data Stewardship for Open Science:** [spg](https://ds-review.ds-wizard.org/book-references/spg)

* 🔗 **External links**: [RDMkit on Data Quality](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_quality.html)
> Working with large amounts of heterogenous data in a larger research group can have implications for the data integrity. How do you make sure every step of the workflow is done with the right version of the data? How do you handle the situation when a mistake is uncovered? Will you be able to redo the strict minimum data handling?

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

## IV. Processing data
> In the processing phase, the data will be undergoing the mostly automated steps for processing, before the analysis and interpretation.
> 
> In this chapter, many questions are focusing on the compute environment that is used to process the data and make it available for interpretation by project partners. Some of those questions (e.g. on workflow systems and data provenance) are also relevant for the work in the interpretation phase.

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 3 Workflow development


> It is likely that you will be developing or modifying the workflow for data processing. There are a lot of aspects of this workflow that can play a role in your data management, such as the use of an existing work flow engine, the use of existing software vs development of new components, and whether every run needs human intervention or whether all data processing can be run in bulk once the work flow has been defined.
✔️ a. This has been arranged


#### 4 How will you make sure to know what exactly has been run?


* 🔗 **External links**: [RDMkit on Data Analysis](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_analysis.html)

* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*



❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 6 Do you need to do compute capacity planning?


> If you require substantial amounts of compute power, amounts that are not trivially absorbed in what you usually have abailable, some planning is necessary. Do you think you need to do compute capacity planning?
✔️ a. No


#### 7 Is the risk of information loss, leaks and vandalism acceptably low?
* 🏷️ **Tags:** *Horizon 2020 DMP*, *Science Europe DMP*, *Horizon Europe DMP*


> There are many factors that can contribute to the risk of information loss or information leaks. They are often part of the behavior of the people that are involved in the project, but can also be steered by properly planned infrastructure.

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

#### 8 Do you have a contingency plan?


> What will you do if the compute facility is down?

❗ *This question has not been answered yet!*

## V. Interpreting data
> The interpretation of the data consists of the last steps of processing (often with manual interventions), visualisation, and data integration. In this chapter many questions about data interoperability will come up.

> Will any of the data that you will be creating form a reference data set for future research (by others)?
> 
> Much of todays data is used in comparison with reference data. You may be comparing your own data with a "standard set" which is maintained as a collection by someone else. Or you could be determining differences to a standard (for example in bioinformatics, a genome is often compared with a reference genome to identify genomic variants). Will you be creating any data that will be reference data for other researchers?
✔️ a. No


## VII. Giving access to data
> This chapter deals with the information needed by people who will re-use your data, and with the access conditions they will need to follow.

* 📖 **Data Stewardship for Open Science:** [jvm](https://ds-review.ds-wizard.org/book-references/jvm)

> The FAIR principles do not contain any direction towards "Openness". This is done on purpose, because there can be compelling reasons not to make data "Open", such as privacy, other sensitive data, or intellectual property protection.
> 
> The true goal of funding agencies is to create the maximum value for society from their investments. They therefore often add "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" to the requirements for funding.
✔️ b. Yes


#### 2 Can all of your data become completely open over time?
