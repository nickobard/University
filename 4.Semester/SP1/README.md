# SP1 - Team Software Product 1

## SYNOPSIS
Students gain hands-on experience with the analysis, design, and prototyping of a large-scale software system. Theoretical support is provided in the BIE-SWI course that runs concurrently and that teaches students necessary techniques and principles. Teams consisting of 4-6 students will work on a specific project. The teacher, in the role of the team and project leader, regularly consults with the team (at the seminars) both the formal and material aspects of the software design. The resulting software artefact will be further developed and finished in the BIE-SP2 course.
