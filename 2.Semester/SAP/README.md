# SAP - Computer Structure and Architecture

# SYNOPSIS
Students will get acquainted with the basic architecture and units of a digital computer, understand the structure, function, and implementation of arithmetic-logic unit , controllers, memory, I/O communication, methods of data transfers between the units. The logic design and the implementation of a program-controlled simple processor is practically implemented in the labs using programmable circuits (FPGA), a single-chip microcomputer, and modern design (EDA) tools.
