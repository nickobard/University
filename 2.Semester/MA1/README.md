# MA1 - Mathematical Analysis 1

## SYNOPSIS
We begin the course by introducing students to the set of real numbers and its properties, and we note its differences with the set of machine numbers. Then we study real sequences and real functions of a real variable. We gradually introduce the notions of limits of sequences and functions, continuous functions, and derivatives of functions. This theoretical foundation is then applied to root-finding problems (iterative method of bisection and Newton’s method), construction of cubic interpolation (spline), and formulation and solution of simple optimization problems (i.e., the issue of finding extrema of functions). The course is closed with the Landau’s asymptotic notation and methods of mathematical description of complexity of algorithms.
