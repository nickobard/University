# PA2 - Programming and Algorithmics 2 (2024)

❗ The code is present in this [repository](https://github.com/nickobard/ZUM-Artificial-Intelligence-Foundations-Practicals). ❗

Here you can see information about the course.

## SYNOPSIS
Students know the instruments of object-oriented programming and are able to use them for specifying and implementing abstract data types (stack, queue, enlargeable array, list, set, table). They learn these skills using the C++ programming language and are introduced to all C++ features needed in object-oriented programming (e.g., template programming, copying/moving of objects, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism).

## COURSE CONTENTS
Students know the instruments of object-oriented programming and are able to use them for specifying and implementing abstract data types (stack, queue, enlargeable array, list, set, table). They learn these skills using the C++ programming language and are introduced to all C++ features needed in object-oriented programming (e.g., template programming, copying/moving of objects, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism).

## GOALS OF STUDY
The aim of the course is to teach students to use the means of object-oriented programming and use them in the specification and implementation of abstract data types with emphasis on implementation using link structures. The course is a compulsory subject of the program, which is followed by a number of other courses.
