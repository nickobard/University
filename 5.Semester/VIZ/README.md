# VIZ - Data Visualization

## Course Projects
- [1. Exploratory Data Analysis](hw01%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
  - Analyzed datasets from the Austin Animal Center to perform exploratory data analysis on animal intakes and outcomes between 2013 and 2022. Cleaned and prepared the data, conducted descriptive statistics, and used visualizations to answer questions about relationships between features like intake type and outcome, the role of animal age in adoption, and seasonal patterns in animal intake.
- [2. Network Analysis of PID](hw02%20-%20Network%20Analysis%20of%20PID)
  - Analyzed the Prague Integrated Transport network by constructing a graph from a dataset of consecutive transport stops. Used network analysis techniques to identify important stops through centrality measures and visualized these results.
- [3. Visualization in Machine Learning](hw03%20-%20Visualization%20in%20Machine%20Learning)
  - Collaborated in a team of three to analyze a publicly available dataset addressing a classification/regression problem using machine learning. My contributions involved conducting an in-depth analysis of linearity and non-linearity in the dataset, as well as developing and tuning an AdaBoost model. I also created visualizations to illustrate the model's performance and to demonstrate how linearity impacted the results.

## SYNOPSIS
The course offers an overview of the types and characteristics of data as well as suitable visualization methods. This will aid the students in understanding data, their content and their application in areas such as data mining and machine learning. Within the course, students will be introduced to exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and ways of visualizing different kinds of data such as text, social networks, time series or basic image data processing. Students will get hands-on experience in applications of selected methods to real-world examples in the Python programming language.
