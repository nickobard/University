# MA2 - Mathematical Analysis 2

## SYNOPSIS
The course completes the theme of analysis of real functions of a real variable initiated in BI-MA1 by introducing the Riemann integral. Students will learn how to integrate by parts and use the substitution method.The next part of the course is devoted to number series, and Taylor polynomials and series. We apply Taylor’s theorem to the computation of elementary functions with a prescribed accuracy. Then we study the linear recurrence equations with constant coefficients, the complexity of recursive algorithms, and its analysis using the Master theorem. Finally, we introduce the student to the theory of multivariate functions. After establishing basic concepts of partial derivative, gradient, and Hessian matrix, we study the analytical method of localization of local extrema of multivariate functions as well as the numerical descent method. We conclude the course with the integration of multivariate functions.
